**ActionGlass** is a realistic glass breaking mechanics plugin for Minecraft servers that adds cinematic, physics-based glass destruction. Experience movie-like action sequences as players crash through windows while flying with elytra, break glass walls while sprinting, or shatter glass floors when falling at high speeds!

## üé¨ Features

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Movement-Based Breaking
- **Elytra Breaking**: Crash through glass structures while gliding at high speeds
- **Sprint Breaking**: Run through glass walls and barriers 
- **Fall Breaking**: Smash through glass floors when falling from heights
- **Speed-Based**: Only break glass when moving fast enough for realistic physics

### üèπ Projectile Breaking
- **Arrow Breaking**: Arrows create small, precise holes in glass
- **Trident Breaking**: Tridents shatter larger areas with more force
- **Wind Charge Breaking**: New 1.20.4+ wind charges create explosive glass breaks
- **Customizable Radius**: Different projectiles break different sized areas

### üîÑ Smart Regeneration
- **Automatic Restoration**: Broken glass regenerates after a configurable delay
- **Visual Effects**: Subtle particle effects when glass regenerates
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient tracking of broken blocks

### üõ°Ô∏è Protection Integration
- **WorldGuard**: Respects region protections
- **GriefPrevention**: Won't break glass in claimed areas
- **Towny**: Honors town permissions
- **Factions**: Respects faction territory

### ‚ö° Performance Features
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking glass breaking calculations
- **Smart Cooldowns**: Prevents spam breaking and server lag
- **Configurable Limits**: Control maximum simultaneous breaks
- **Optimized Detection**: Efficient collision detection algorithms

## üì• Installation

### Requirements
- **Java 17+** (Required for modern Minecraft versions)
- **Spigot/Paper 1.20.4+** (Recommended: Paper for better performance)
- **Optional**: WorldGuard, GriefPrevention, Towny, or Factions for protection integration

### Installation Steps

1. **Download** the latest ActionGlass.jar from [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/ActionGlass/releases)

2. **Upload** the jar file to your server's `plugins/` directory

3. **Restart** your server (or use `/reload` if you must)

4. **Configure** the plugin by editing `plugins/ActionGlass/config.yml`

5. **Test** the plugin by flying into glass with elytra or shooting arrows at glass blocks

## üéÆ Usage

### For Players

#### Elytra Breaking
1. Equip elytra and rockets
2. Launch into flight
3. Build up speed (the faster, the better!)
4. Fly directly into glass structures
5. Watch as you crash through in cinematic style!

#### Sprint Breaking  
1. Start sprinting (double-tap W or hold Ctrl)
2. Run directly at glass walls or barriers
3. Break through at full speed
4. Works best with thin glass structures (1 block thick)

#### Fall Breaking
1. Jump or fall from a significant height
2. Land on or fall through glass structures
3. High-speed impacts will shatter the glass
4. Great for dramatic entrances!

#### Projectile Breaking
1. Shoot arrows, throw tridents, or use wind charges
2. Aim at glass blocks or structures  
3. Different projectiles create different break patterns
4. Experiment with angles and distances!

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Performance Tuning

For **large servers** (100+ players):
```yaml
settings:
  glass-break-cooldown: 1000         # Longer cooldown
advanced:
  max-simultaneous-breaks: 25        # Lower limit
  async-processing: true             # Enable async
  max-blocks-per-tick: 5             # Process fewer blocks per tick
```

For **small servers** (< 50 players):
```yaml
settings:
  glass-break-cooldown: 250          # Shorter cooldown  
advanced:
  max-simultaneous-breaks: 100       # Higher limit
  max-blocks-per-tick: 20            # Process more blocks per tick
```

### Realistic Physics Settings

For **movie-like action**:
```yaml
settings:
  minimum-speed: 0.2                 # Easier to break glass
break-radius:
  elytra: 3                          # Larger crash patterns
  sprinting: 3                       # Bigger sprint breaks
  falling: 3                         # Dramatic fall impacts
```

For **realistic physics**:
```yaml
settings:
  minimum-speed: 0.5                 # Need more speed
break-radius:
  elytra: 1                          # Smaller, precise breaks
  sprinting: 1                       # Minimal sprint breaking
  falling: 2                         # Moderate fall damage
```

### Protection Plugin Integration

#### WorldGuard Setup
1. Install WorldGuard on your server
2. ActionGlass will automatically detect it
3. Glass won't break in protected regions
4. Configure in config.yml:
```yaml
integrations:
  worldguard:
    enabled: true
    respect-regions: true
```

#### GriefPrevention Setup  
1. Install GriefPrevention
2. ActionGlass respects all claims automatically
3. Players can't break glass in others' claims
```yaml
integrations:
  griefprevention:
    enabled: true
    respect-claims: true
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Glass Not Breaking
**Problem**: Players can't break glass despite high speed
**Solutions**:
- Check if the feature is enabled in config.yml
- Verify minimum-speed setting isn't too high
- Ensure the player has necessary permissions
- Check if the area is protected by WorldGuard/other plugins

#### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Server lag when breaking glass
**Solutions**:
- Reduce `max-simultaneous-breaks` in config
- Increase `glass-break-cooldown` 
- Enable `async-processing`
- Lower `max-blocks-per-tick`

#### Glass Not Regenerating
**Problem**: Broken glass doesn't restore
**Solutions**:
- Verify `regeneration: true` in config
- Check `regeneration-delay` setting
- Ensure server isn't restarting before regen time
- Use `/actionglass regenerate` to force restoration

#### Plugin Conflicts
**Problem**: ActionGlass conflicts with other plugins
**Solutions**:
- Check plugin load order in server logs
- Disable conflicting features in other plugins
- Update all plugins to latest versions
- Contact support with specific error messages

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:
```yaml
advanced:
  debug-mode: true
```

This will log detailed information about:
- Glass breaking attempts
- Speed calculations  
- Permission checks
- Protection plugin interactions

## üîÑ API for Developers

ActionGlass provides a comprehensive API for other plugin developers:

### Maven Dependency
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.actionglass</groupId>
    <artifactId>ActionGlass</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Basic API Usage
```java
// Get ActionGlass instance
ActionGlass actionGlass = (ActionGlass) Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("ActionGlass");

// Check if glass breaking is enabled
if (actionGlass.isElytraBreakingEnabled()) {
    // Your code here
}

// Get glass manager
GlassManager glassManager = actionGlass.getGlassManager();

// Break glass programmatically
Location glassLocation = new Location(world, x, y, z);
glassManager.breakGlassArea(glassLocation, 2);

// Check if a material is glass
if (glassManager.isGlass(Material.GLASS)) {
    // Handle glass block
}
```

### Events
ActionGlass fires custom events that other plugins can listen to:

```java
@EventHandler
public void onGlassBreak(GlassBreakEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    Block glassBlock = event.getGlassBlock();
    GlassBreakCause cause = event.getCause(); // ELYTRA, ARROW, FALLING, etc.
    
    // Cancel the event to prevent breaking
    event.setCancelled(true);
}

@EventHandler  
public void onGlassRegenerate(GlassRegenerateEvent event) {
    Location location = event.getLocation();
    Material glassType = event.getGlassType();
    
    // Handle glass regeneration
}
```

## üìä Statistics & Metrics

ActionGlass tracks various statistics that can be viewed with `/actionglass status`:

- **Total Glass Broken**: Lifetime count of broken glass blocks
- **Currently Broken**: Number of glass blocks awaiting regeneration  
- **Break Methods**: Breakdown by elytra, arrows, falling, etc.
- **Top Players**: Players who have broken the most glass
- **Performance Metrics**: Average processing times and server impact
